## Live URL
* http://p2.jarekfrackowiak.me

## Description
This simple PHP application generates a "correct horse battery staple" style user password that
was originally suggested by a [comic](http://xkcd.com/936/) on the [xkcd.com](http://xkcd.com/)
site by [Randall Munroe](http://xkcd.com/about/).

The application allows the user to specify a few option such as the number of words, uppercase
first letter, use a symbol, include a number, and a dictionary "theme" for word generation.

## Demo
TBD
